# graphql-node-react

This application uses node express for the backend with graphql and react js for the frontend

The graphql server is the simple native graphql server which is very raw,  unlike apollo server

The app uses a light mongo atlas cluster, you can replace the env variables in the nodemon.json if you are having issues with the connection to the cluster
